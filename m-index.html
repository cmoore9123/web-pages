						<p>Welcome to Dataconductor, I created this website to showcase the capabilities of modern open source software coupled with cloud based computing. The data for the World Development Indicators visualisation is sourced from the <a href="http://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/" style="color: white;">World Bank</a>'s site. An overview of the tech used in this site can be found in the technology section.</p>

					<button class="subtitle">R Language for Statistical Analysis</button>

					<div class="tech_content">
 						Computer language with a focus on statistical data analysis. R was developed in the 90's from its predecessor "S" and since has grown and increased in popularity. Constantly gaining new functionalities through user contributed <i>packages</i> designed to assist in various tasks.
						. tidyverse/tidydata - Data rarely starts its existence in usable state. You'll need to process it into a form you can use. This is the realm of the <i>tidyverse</i>
						.leaflet
						.sf
						.shiny
					</div>

					<button class="subtitle">Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)</button>

					<div class="tech_content">
						 <p>Databases are the most efficient and reliable method of storing data. Data is stored in a hierarchical structure with a server at the top level. The <i>server</i> contains <i>databases</i> which in turn hold <i>schemas</i> within them, these schemas hold <i>tables</i> which are made up of <i>fields</i>.</p>
						 <p>When tables have fields that contain values which are shared with other tables then these tables can be joined on those fields.</p>
						 <p>Some of the most popular RDBM systems use today are <i>Microsoft SQL Server</i>, <i>MySQL</i> and <i>Oracle Database</i>. This site uses MySQL which is the most popular open source RDBMS.</p>
					</div>

					<button class="subtitle">Structured Query Language (SQL)</button>

					<div class="tech_content">
						  <p><i>SQL</i> is the means by which to communicate with an RDBMS. Allowing the use to alter the structure of a database, input and extract data.</p>
						  <p>The most frequent action in the world of data analytics is extracting data, known as querying. Here is an example of a query used in the World Development Index dashboard above</p> 
						  <p>Each RDBMS has it own version of SQL. Microsoft SQL Server has T-SQL, MySQL's version is simply called MySQL and Oracle Database has PL/SQL. These are fundementally very similar to one another but differ slightly in their syntax.</p>
					</div>

					<button class="subtitle">Google Analytics</button>

					<div class="tech_content">
						<p>Google Analytics is a free tool provided by Google used to monitor traffic on a website. This provides website owners insights into how a user interacts with their site. When this data is analysed properly it highlights areas of concern and opportunities for optimisation.</p>
						<p>This is achieved through snippets of JavaScript embedded within a website that send user action data out to Google's servers.</p>
						<p>The data is made up of <i>metrics</i> and <i>dimensions</i>. A metric would be something like a page view that can be counted. Or average time on page which can be assigned a specific numeric value. A dimension is something like a device type which has defined categories (mobile, desktop, tablet) that the metrics fall into. Metrics can be turned into dimension by <i>bucketing</i> them. So we could lets say have a dimension called timeOnPage which has categories of  <1 minute and  >1 minute</p>
						<p>Google Analytics comes with hundreds of predefined metrics and dimensions out of the box. But also gives the option to define custom metrics and dimensions as required. If for example you wanted to track how often a specific button on your site was clicked you could <i>tag</i> this button with some JavaScript code and assign this code to metric. When the button was clicked the JavaScript would send this data to your Google Analytics account. </p>
						<p>One of the keys to gaining insights from your web analytics is proper <i>segmentation</i> of your audience. Segmentation means assigning users to groups known as segments then comparing and contrasting the behaviors of these segments. For example breaking users down into different browser types and looking at the average time they spend on your website. If a particular browser has significantly worse metrics than the others it could mean your site isn't rendering properly in that browser. </p>
					</div>

					<button class="subtitle">Cloud Computing</button>

					<div class="tech_content">
						<p>This site, the apps contained within it and the data the apps run from are all hosted in the "Cloud" through the provider <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/"> DigitalOcean</a>. With 2GB RAM and 50GB disk space costing $10 per month to rent. This $10 per month makes up the entirity of the expense of this site.</p>
						<p>Hosting in this manner provides many benefits. Such as security, flexibility, scalability and price. There is no on-premise hardware that needs to be protected and maintained. If your cloud machine ever needs more RAM or disk space you can simply up the resources of your machine through your digital ocean account in a process that takes less than a minute.</p>
						<p>Many businesses are moving their IT infrastructure to the cloud for these reasons.</p>
					</div>

					<button class="subtitle">Linux Ubuntu</button>

					<div class="tech_content">
						<p>The machine hosting this site runs on Ubuntu, a distribution of the open source operating system Linux.</p>
					</div>

					<button class="subtitle">Web Servers</button>

					<div class="tech_content">
						<p>This site makes use of both Nginx and Apache HTTP web servers for handling web traffic. With Nginx acting as a <i>reverse proxy server</i> for Apache. This configuration increases the security of the site, makes use of Nginx superior speed as a web server and provides load balancing functionality.</p>
					</div>

					<button class="subtitle">JavaScript</button>

					<div class="tech_content">
						<p>JavaScript controls the interactive aspect of websites. Triggering events like a menu expanding when a button is clicked or redirecting a visitor to a different page based on a certain criteria. For example this site uses JavaScript to detect the pixel width of your device when you land on the home page. It will automatically send you to the mobile version of the site if this width is less than 800 pixels.</p> 
					</div>

					<button class="subtitle">HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</button>

					<div class="tech_content">
						<p>Defines the objects from which web page are built using <i>tags</i>. These tags define the type of element you want to include. for example the tag for including a paragraph of text is p, the image tag is img. A block of HTML code begins with a tag contained within pointy brackets and ends with the tag contained within the pointy brackets again but proceeded with a forward slash. So the following code block inserts a paragraph into a webpage &ltp&gttext to show on page&lt/p&gt</p> <p>These tags are contained within each other to form a hierarchy. Tags used to display content are nearly always contained within a tag called div (standing for division). These divisions form the skeleton of the site.</p>
					</div>

					<button class="subtitle">CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)</button>

					<div class="tech_content">
						<p>Without CSS a web page would still display all of the content contained in its HTML tags but not in an appealing format. CSS Creates rules that are then attached to HTML tags. These rules are used to control the appearance of the tags on the web page. Affecting things such as
 						   colour, size and spacing. The CSS code can be imbedded directly into a web page within "STYLE" tags. Or more commonly stored in a seperate file which
 						   the web page file will link to, called a CSS stylesheet. This allows the single file to set rules shared across multiple web pages.</p>
